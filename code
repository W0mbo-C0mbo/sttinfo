    <p>The island is serviced by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_E._King_International_Airport">Cyril E. King International Airport</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Amalie_Harbor_Seaplane_Base">Charlotte Amalie Harbor <br>Seaplane Base.</a></p>
<p><br>Passenger and limited car-ferry services to neighboring islands such as Water Island, Saint John,<br> Saint Croix, and the British Virgin Islands run regularly out of the Red Hook Terminal, Charlotte Amalie,<br> and Crown Bay Marina.<br></p>
The United States Virgin Islands is the only place under United States jurisdiction where the rule of<br> the road is to <span style="color: red;">drive on the left</span>. This was inherited from what was the then-current Danish practice at<br> the time of the American acquisition in 1917. However, because the islands are a U.S. territory, most cars<br> are imported from the mainland United States and therefore the steering column is located on the left side of the vehicle.
